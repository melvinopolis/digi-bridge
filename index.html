			<h4>Advocacy</h4>

			<div class="arrow-box">
				<p>Digi-Bridge uses a community organizing model to ignite conversation and action within neighborhoods, working with school districts to create model K-12 settings with technology-rich course offerings. We work to secure capital (both financial and human) to support our advocacy efforts. </p>

				<p>The problem facing educators is access to the resources and supports necessary to empower this generation of learners. Digi-Bridge tackles this issue of access in an effort to move our nation towards an educational landscape where every student is afforded a quality, 21st century learning experience. There is no advocacy group in Charlotte specifically focused on issues of digital access (access to low-cost hardware/software, school based computer science education courses, and ongoing tutorials).</p>

			<h4>Consulting</h4>

			<div class="arrow-box">
				<p>Schools don&#39;t have an impartial, unaffiliated voice supporting them as they determine what technology resources should be introduced into the learning environment. Further, many schools don&#39;t have the supports in place to leverage existing technologies.</p>

				<p>To address this need, Digi-Bridge works with community shareholders to assess need and identify opportunities. Our hardware and software agnostic approach means that you&#39;re getting recommendations that meet the needs of your school. Our work is mission-driven and we are not beholden to any market.</p>

			<h4>Education</h4>
			<div class="arrow-box">
				<p>During the academic day, most students donâ€™t have access to high-quality, 21st century programming in the areas of science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics&mdash;or STEAM.</p>

				<p>Digi-Bridge offers students and their families opportunities to engage in hands-on learning experiences outside the traditional school day. Designed by educators, our curriculum includes a variety of learning modules in science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics. For example... ***NEED EXAMPLE***. </p>

				<p>Our goal is to fill course seats and identify partners who will help to fund programs in under-served neighborhoods.</p>
